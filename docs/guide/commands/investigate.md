# AI-Driven Intelligent Investigation System

The Intelligent Investigation System is a powerful AI-driven feature that automatically analyzes Application Insights problems, generates dynamic investigation plans, and provides root cause analysis with actionable recommendations.

## Features

- üó£Ô∏è **Natural Language Input**: Describe problems in plain English
- üß† **AI Analysis**: Automatic problem classification and investigation planning  
- üîç **Dynamic Investigation**: Multi-phase adaptive query execution
- üéØ **Root Cause Analysis**: Evidence-based cause identification with confidence scores
- üí° **Actionable Recommendations**: Specific solutions and prevention strategies

## Quick Start

### Basic Investigation
```bash
# Describe the problem naturally
aidx investigate "Application is responding slowly"

# Specify the investigation type
aidx investigate "Users are getting 500 errors" --type availability

# Set maximum investigation time
aidx investigate "Missing telemetry data" --max-time 10
```

### Interactive Mode
```bash
# Launch interactive guided investigation
aidx investigate --interactive

# This will prompt you for:
# - Problem description
# - Issue type (if unsure, AI will classify)
# - Severity level
# - Affected services
```

### Investigation Management
```bash
# Check status of an ongoing investigation
aidx investigate --status <investigation-id>

# Continue a specific investigation
aidx investigate --continue <investigation-id>

# Pause an investigation
aidx investigate --pause <investigation-id>

# Resume a paused investigation
aidx investigate --resume <investigation-id>

# Cancel an investigation
aidx investigate --cancel <investigation-id>

# View investigation history
aidx investigate --history
```

### Export Results
```bash
# Export as markdown report (default)
aidx investigate --export <investigation-id>

# Export as HTML report
aidx investigate --export <investigation-id> --format html

# Export as JSON data
aidx investigate --export <investigation-id> --format json
```

## Investigation Types

The system supports four main investigation types, each with specialized analysis approaches:

### üêå Performance Issues
**Examples**: Slow response times, high latency, throughput problems
**Analysis Focus**:
- Response time trends and baselines
- Dependency performance analysis
- Resource utilization patterns
- Query performance bottlenecks

```bash
aidx investigate "API response times are 5x slower than normal"
```

### üö´ Availability Issues  
**Examples**: Service outages, 500 errors, downtime events
**Analysis Focus**:
- Error rate analysis and trends
- Success rate monitoring
- Service health checks
- Downtime timeline reconstruction

```bash
aidx investigate "Users getting 500 errors since 2 PM"
```

### üìä Data Quality Issues
**Examples**: Missing telemetry, data inconsistencies, incomplete logs
**Analysis Focus**:
- Data completeness analysis
- Missing telemetry detection
- Data consistency validation
- Sampling rate verification

```bash
aidx investigate "Request telemetry missing for mobile app"
```

### üîó Dependency Issues
**Examples**: External service failures, third-party problems, connection issues
**Analysis Focus**:
- Dependency call analysis
- External service health monitoring
- Connection failure patterns
- Timeout and retry behavior

```bash
aidx investigate "Payment service integration failing intermittently"
```

## How It Works

### 1. Problem Classification
When you describe a problem, the AI analyzes the description to:
- Classify the problem type (performance, availability, data-quality, dependencies)
- Assess confidence level of classification
- Generate reasoning for the classification

### 2. Investigation Planning
Based on the problem type, the system:
- Creates a multi-phase investigation plan
- Generates specific KQL queries for each phase
- Estimates execution time and sets priorities
- Defines dependencies between phases

### 3. Automated Execution
The system executes the investigation by:
- Running queries systematically across phases
- Collecting and analyzing results using AI
- Building evidence trail with significance scoring
- Adapting plan based on intermediate findings

### 4. Root Cause Analysis
At completion, the system provides:
- Primary cause identification with confidence scores
- Contributing factors analysis
- Timeline of events
- Business impact assessment

### 5. Actionable Recommendations
The final report includes:
- **Immediate actions**: Urgent steps to resolve the issue
- **Short-term fixes**: Quick improvements to implement
- **Long-term solutions**: Architectural or process improvements
- **Prevention strategies**: How to avoid similar issues

```bash
# List recent investigations to find the ID
aidx investigate --history

# Resume the investigation
aidx investigate --resume inv_abc123
```

### Custom Time Limits
Control investigation duration:

```bash

## Integration with Existing Features

The investigation system integrates seamlessly with existing AppInsights Detective features:

- **AI Providers**: Uses your configured AI provider (Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, etc.)
- **Data Sources**: Works with Application Insights, Log Analytics, and Azure Data Explorer
- **Templates**: Generated queries can be saved as templates
- **Interactive Mode**: Combines with existing interactive session capabilities
- **Output Formats**: Supports all standard output formats and file exports

## Configuration

The investigation system uses your existing AppInsights Detective configuration. Ensure you have:

1. **AI Provider configured**: Required for problem classification and plan generation
2. **Data Source configured**: Required for query execution
3. **Authentication setup**: Required for accessing Application Insights data

```bash
# Check your configuration
aidx status

# Setup if needed
aidx setup
```

## Best Practices

### When to Use Investigations

**‚úÖ Good Use Cases**:
- Complex multi-system issues requiring systematic analysis
- Incidents requiring rapid root cause identification
- Performance problems with unknown causes
- Issues requiring comprehensive evidence collection

**‚ùì Consider Alternatives**:
- Simple, well-understood queries ‚Üí Use `aidx "query description"`
- Exploratory analysis ‚Üí Use `aidx --interactive`
- Known issues with established queries ‚Üí Use templates

### Problem Descriptions

Write clear, specific problem descriptions:

**‚úÖ Good Examples**:
- "API response times increased from 200ms to 2s since 3 PM"
- "Users in Europe getting 500 errors when uploading files"
- "Missing request telemetry for mobile app version 2.1.3"

**‚ùå Vague Examples**:
- "Something is wrong"
- "App is broken"
- "Performance issues"

### Investigation Management

- Monitor long-running investigations with `--status`
- Use `--max-time` to prevent investigations from running too long
- Export important investigation results for documentation
- Review `--history` to learn from past investigations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Investigation won't start**:
- Check AI provider configuration: `aidx status`
- Verify data source connectivity
- Ensure problem description is specific enough

**Investigation stuck/slow**:
- Check investigation status: `aidx investigate --status <id>`
- Consider canceling and restarting with shorter time limit
- Verify Application Insights data availability

**Poor classification accuracy**:
- Provide more specific problem descriptions
- Manually specify investigation type with `--type`
- Review and adjust investigation plan in interactive mode

**Missing evidence**:
- Ensure sufficient data exists in the time range
- Check Application Insights data retention settings
- Verify permissions for data access
